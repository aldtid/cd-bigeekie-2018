== Steps to create a job in Jenkins

. Login in link:https://dcip.hi.inet/[EPG Jenkins] and create a personal folder.
. Access that new created folder and create a `New Item > Freestyle project`, and set a name for the job.
. Configure the job:
.. Check `General > Github project` and set your project url.
.. Check `Source Code Management > Git`:
... Set your repository URL.
... Add `contint/****** (GITHUB only user)` credentials.
... Set the branch to track (i.e., to track master it would be `*/master`).
... Add `githubweb` repository browser and project `URL`.
.. Check `Build Triggers > GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`.
.. Check `Build > Execute shell` and add a simple command, for example: `echo "Hello world!`.
.. Save changes.
. Configure your repository:
.. Go to `Settings > Webhooks` and click on `Add webhook`:
... Add Jenkins Payload URL: `http://dcip.tid.es/github-webhook/`
... Click on `Add webhook`.

And that's it!
